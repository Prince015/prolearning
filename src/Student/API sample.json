Here are the key features of React:\n\n1. Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to represent the UI, which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. Manipulating the virtual DOM is less expensive because it doesn't require a full screen rendering, enabling the app to be more performant overall.\n\n2. Component-Based Architecture: React uses reusable and modular components to build complex UI. Components can also be compiled or nested as a higher-order component to share content and achieve a more functional design.\n\n3. Unidirectional Data Flow: Data flows through the application in one direction, making it easier to manage changes.\n\n4. JSX: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JS code, making it easier to create UI components.\n\nNow, let's move on to useMemo hook in React.\n\nuseMemo is a React hook that is used to perform expensive calculations and then store the computed value. This can help improve the performance of the application by avoiding unnecessary re-renders. When React components are rendered, they typically run all their calculations again, even if the props have not changed. useMemo will keep track of what parameters were passed, so if they did not change, the computation will not run again.\n\nHere's how to use useMemo:\n\n```\nimport React, { useMemo } from 'react';\n\nfunction MyComponent(props) {\n\n  const expensiveResult = useMemo(() => {\n    // Calculate any expensive value\n    return props.someProp * 2 + props.anotherProp;\n  }, [props.someProp, props.anotherProp]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{expensiveResult }</h1>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we use useMemo to compute an expensive calculation relative to the `props` argument. The calculation will only re-run when either `someProp` or `anotherProp` change. This enables the re-use of the previous calculation, improving the overall application performance."
